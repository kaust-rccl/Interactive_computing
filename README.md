# Interactive_computing
A bag of scripts enabling interactive sessions on compute nodes of Shaheen and IBEX.

### Jupyter notebooks 
Jupyter notebooks are popular request to run on KSL platforms on Compute nodes. 
The idea is to run remote servers on compute nodes of a cluster with port forwarding and connect to the notebook on a local browser.

1. The script "jupyter_server_jobscript_ibex.slurm" launches a remote jupyter notebook server on IBEX compute nodes with GPUs.
